# Metacircular-Evaluator
A MIT-Scheme evaluator implemented by Scheme


> The evaluator, which determines the meaning of expressions in a programming language, is just another program.


## solving the definition mask issue of procedure apply
Having two different things called apply leads to a technical problem in running the metacircular evaluator, because defining the metacircular evaluatorâ€™s apply will mask the definition of the primitive.Here we have renamed the metacircular apply as meta-apply to avoid conflict with the name of the primitive procedure apply, which enable us to reference the underlying apply procedure in Scheme System by defining the apply-in-underlying-scheme procedure.

      (define apply-in-underlying-scheme apply)
